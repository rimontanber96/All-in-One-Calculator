🧮 All-in-One Calculator (C++)

An interactive menu-driven multiple calculator program written in C++.
This project combines three different calculators into a single console application:

🔬 Scientific Calculator

🎓 CGPA Calculator

💸 Discount Calculator

It is suitable for beginners, college assignments, and basic C++ practice involving functions, loops, conditionals, and mathematical operations.

✨ Features
1️⃣ Scientific Calculator

Supports common mathematical operations:

Addition

Subtraction

Multiplication

Division (with division-by-zero handling)

Square Root

Power

Trigonometric functions:

sin()

cos()

tan()

📌 Note: Trigonometric functions take input in radians.

2️⃣ CGPA Calculator

Calculates CGPA based on:

Grade points

Subject credits

Uses weighted average formula:

CGPA = (Σ (grade × credit)) / (Σ credits)

3️⃣ Discount Calculator

Calculates the final price after applying a discount percentage:

Final Price = Price − (Price × Discount / 100)

🛠️ Technologies Used

Language: C++

Libraries: <bits/stdc++.h>

Concepts Used:

Functions

Switch-case

Loops

Conditional statements

Mathematical operations

🚀 How to Run

Compile the program

g++ calculator.cpp -o calculator


Run the executable

./calculato
🎯 Learning Outcomes
